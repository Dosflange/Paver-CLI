# Paver-CLI

These is a cleaned-up WIP including the native Paver assembler source I was using for the various implementations of that CPU, notably the [FPGA version](https://github.com/Dosflange/Paver).

The tool (hen) loads the native binary version of the assembler and emulates the CPU to assemble a new version of itself (the egg).
